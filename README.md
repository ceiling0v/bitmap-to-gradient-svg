# bitmap-to-gradient-svg

A very basic GUI tool I made for creating consistently themed icons in SVG format to use for my projects--16x16 pixel art shapes that use color gradients. It runs in [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) 4.6, using GDScript.

At this point, its functionality is quite limited, as **it's mostly just a proof of concept**. The SVGs exports are currently **very** unoptimized; the output uses a rectangle shape to represent each individual pixel from its source bitmap.
